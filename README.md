Instructions

I tried to design a slim enclosure again using a channel outside between the top and bottom part to let the case apear more flat - and, to cover possible impressisions ;-).
I recommend to print the parts in different colors.

Fix the holder and glue the plastic part harder to the plate or otherwise screw the nut and so that the medium does not move

move the infill to 35 - 50 percentage and so the material is so strong
there is no need for printing rafts for this material and so that it can fit in the heat-bead and dont wrap from it
